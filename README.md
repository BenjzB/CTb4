# CTb4
Name: Benji Beckler


Period: 4


Virtual / Hybrid / In-Person Class: Hybrid Class




Programming Experience: A few months of learning Python. A little practice with HTML, and I've coded different programs (including a VR space and a discord bot).


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


Last year, I learned about Python functions and how to create simple programs. We used a little bit of HTML for VR spaces, as well as files that we created to put in a browser. I practiced using Python and learning what features it has.



10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).

In 10th grade, I created dice rolling and card picking programs at the beginning of the year. After a few months, we moved into binary and hexadecimal numbers, as well as how the internet works. Then, I created a discord bot that was able to send direct messages to users and greeting them, as well as do small web searches.



What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


This year, I would like to improve my programming skills by learning new aspects of Python, and functions that I haven't learned before.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


I feel that this class challenges me differently than HUMLA, because it's an experience where I'm still learning the basics of and I'm not really sure most of the time. In HUMLA, I know the basics and how to read and write. In programming, I don't know how to do everything.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


My goal with computer programming is to be able to create programs that I can use and apply to certain things in life, as well as be able to get a good score on my AP CSP test. I think that computational thinking is important in helping me think critically in different ways, so I think it applies to problem solving in some of my other goals in life.
